    "In this lab, we will cover how to compare your independent and dependent variables to evaluate whether your variables move together as expected in your hypothesis. For each of the tests, we will present the distribution of cases across values of your dependent variable as we move across values of the independent variable. We will utilize three main tests: cross-tabulations, mean comparison tests, and scatterplots. Of course, many more ways to compare two variables together exist, but these three are core starting points. We will also learn how to conduct these comparisons while holding constant a third variable. "
