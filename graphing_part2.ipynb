    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will cover a few more graph types and illustrate additional ways to control the look of your graphs in R using `ggplot`. We will use a famous data source: Poole and Rosenthal's (plus additional contributors) [DW-Nominate scores](https://voteview.com/data). While technically they are measures of agreement in roll-call voting, we often use them to create estimates of ideological ideal-points for members of Congress over time. They can be used to study polarization and extremism among legislators. Higher values are more conservative and lower values are more liberal. I have aggregated the DW-Nominate scores by Congress for members of the each party in the U.S. House from 1871 (42nd Congress) until today. Let's get started!"

    "Now, let's make a few changes to these data to aid in our analysis. First, let's create a measure of ideological polarization of the parties. We can do that taking the absolute value of the difference between each party's median ideal-point estimate. These are currently stored in separate variables, `Dem.med` and `Rep.med`. Second, let's code a new `year` variable from the included `congress` variable. `congress` ranges from 42 (42nd Congress) to 119 (119th Congress). Finally, let's take our year variable to code a `decade` variable. The code below uses the `%/%` syntax to pull out the first three digits of the year and ignoring the remainder ( for example, `1885` would result in `188`). Then it multiples that number by 10 to get back to the decade: `1880`."
