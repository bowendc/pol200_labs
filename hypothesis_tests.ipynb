    "When conducting a cross-tab or a mean comparison test earlier in the semester, we were unable to say whether any difference in the dependent variable was \"big enough\". Well, hypothesis testing gives one way to make that determination. Is the observed relationship large enough that we are confident it is not a result of sampling error? Let's revisit our basic comparison tests from several weeks ago."

All of these can be changed as needed, but will typically be what you will want to use. Note that the function accepts vectors of data for `x` and `y`, so below we use `filter()` and `select()` to grab just the data we need."
