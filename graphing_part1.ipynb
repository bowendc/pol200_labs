To make our lives easier, we'll be using the `fake` dataframe we used in some of our previous labs. First, let's use the `pacman` package to load the **tidyverse**. We'll also install and load **RColorBrewer**, which provides access to some nice color palettes we can use for graphing."

The easiest way to do this is to change the graph aesthetics to allow a `fill` category. We use the `factor` function to inform R that variable `w` is a nominal, not numeric, variable. Then, we use `scale_fill_brewer()` to define the color scale we want to use. Here, we use the `Dark2` scale from the `RColorBrewer` package. There are many cool color palettes.
